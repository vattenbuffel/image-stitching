	we use spatially varying non rigid transforms
	3 steps: 1 homography finding 
		     2 homography filtering 
			 3 homography refinement
	
	1) Two images, I1, I2. Compute a set of keypoints which exists in both images (SIFT ?)
	   Now compute homographies:
			for T
				p = random pixel
				if 4(?) keypoints inside a circle of radius r with p in middle:
					Calculate H and add to list
	
	2) Screen all the homographies. Deduplicate the remaining homographies
	
	   Screning) Screening removes 2 kinds of homographies. Those who will give unlikely to give realistic
           	     images and those who are close to identity. 2 methods are used. The first is to checking the 
				 difference between a similarity motion between the images. This is done like:
					H_s = argmin(H_s) sum(norm(H_s*C_i - H*c_i)), where H_s = [a -b c; b a d]
					if sum(norm(H_s*C_i - H*C_i)) < 0.01 discard H
				 
				 
				 Checking the magnitude of the scaling 
				 parameters.
