	we use spatially varying non rigid transforms
	3 steps: 1 homography finding 
		     2 homography filtering 
			 3 homography refinement
	
	1) Two images, I1, I2. Compute a set of keypoints which exists in both images (SIFT ?)
	   Now compute homographies:
			for T
				p = random pixel
				if 4(?) keypoints inside a circle of radius r with p in middle:
					Calculate H and add to list
	2) 
	3)
